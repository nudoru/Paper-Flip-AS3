Paper-Flip-AS3
==============

As an experiment for a learning interaction, I created this page flip effect from a Papervision 3d flip book effect. I don't remember which one (it's been quite a while!).

I took out the code an individual page and wrapped it in an easier to use class.

The end result was something that I could use for a piece of paper of a note pad. It turned out pretty good and got a lot of use in the course.

Other libraries used:
GreenSock's Tween Library
Papervision 3d
